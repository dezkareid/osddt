### Resolving the Feature Name

Use the following logic to determine `<feature-name>`:

1. If arguments were provided, derive the feature name from them:
   - If the argument looks like a branch name (no spaces, kebab-case or slash-separated), use the last segment (after the last `/`, or the full value if no `/` is present).
   - Otherwise treat it as a human-readable description and convert it to a feature name following the constraints in the Feature Name Constraints section.
2. If **no arguments were provided**:
   - List all folders under `<project-path>/working-on/`.
   - If there is **only one folder**, use it automatically and inform the user.
   - If there are **multiple folders**, present the list to the user and ask them to pick one.
   - If there are **no folders**, inform the user that no in-progress features were found and stop.

## Instructions

1. Check whether `osddt.plan.md` already exists in the working directory:
   - If it **does not exist**, proceed to generate it.
   - If it **already exists**, ask the user whether to:
     - **Regenerate** — discard the existing file and create a fresh plan from scratch
     - **Update** — read the existing file and apply targeted changes based on $ARGUMENTS
     - **Do nothing** — stop here and leave the file as-is
2. Read `osddt.spec.md` from the working directory
3. Check for unanswered open questions in the spec:
   - Count the items in the **Open Questions** section that have no corresponding entry in the **Decisions** section.
   - If there are any unanswered questions, inform the user: "This spec has X unanswered open question(s)."
   - Ask the user whether to:
     - **Clarify first** — stop here and suggest running `/osddt.clarify <feature-name>` instead
     - **Proceed anyway** — continue with plan generation using the spec as-is
   - If there are no unanswered questions, proceed silently.
4. Break down the implementation into logical phases and steps
5. Identify technical decisions, dependencies, and risks
6. Write the plan to `osddt.plan.md` in the working directory

## Plan Format

The plan should include:
- **Architecture Overview**: High-level design decisions
- **Implementation Phases**: Ordered phases with goals
- **Technical Dependencies**: Libraries, APIs, services needed
- **Risks & Mitigations**: Known risks and how to address them
- **Out of Scope**: Explicitly what will not be built

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS

## Next Step

Run the following command to generate the task list:

```
/osddt.tasks
```
