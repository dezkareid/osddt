### Resolving the Feature Name

Use the following logic to determine `<feature-name>`:

1. If arguments were provided, derive the feature name from them:
   - If the argument looks like a branch name (no spaces, kebab-case or slash-separated), use the last segment (after the last `/`, or the full value if no `/` is present).
   - Otherwise treat it as a human-readable description and convert it to a feature name following the constraints in the Feature Name Constraints section.
2. If **no arguments were provided**:
   - List all folders under `<project-path>/working-on/`.
   - If there is **only one folder**, use it automatically and inform the user.
   - If there are **multiple folders**, present the list to the user and ask them to pick one.
   - If there are **no folders**, inform the user that no in-progress features were found and stop.

## Instructions

1. Check whether `osddt.tasks.md` already exists in the working directory:
   - If it **does not exist**, proceed to generate it.
   - If it **already exists**, ask the user whether to:
     - **Regenerate** — discard the existing file and create a fresh task list from scratch
     - **Do nothing** — stop here and leave the file as-is
2. Read `osddt.plan.md` from the working directory
3. Break each phase into discrete, executable tasks
4. Estimate complexity (S/M/L) for each task
5. Write the task list to `osddt.tasks.md` in the working directory

## Tasks Format

The task list should include:
- **Checklist** of tasks grouped by phase
- Each task should be: `- [ ] [S/M/L] Description of task`
- **Dependencies**: Note which tasks must complete before others
- **Definition of Done**: Clear completion criteria per phase

## Next Step

Run the following command to start implementing tasks:

```
/osddt.implement
```
