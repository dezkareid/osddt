description: "Start a new feature by creating a branch and working-on folder"

## Context

Before proceeding, run the following command and parse the JSON output to get the current branch and date:

```
npx osddt meta-info
```

## Repository Configuration

Before proceeding, read the `.osddtrc` file in the root of the repository to determine the project path.

```json
// .osddtrc example
{ "repoType": "monorepo" | "single" }
```

- If `repoType` is `"single"`: the project path is the repository root.
- If `repoType` is `"monorepo"`: ask the user which package to work on (e.g. `packages/my-package`), then use `<repo-root>/<package>` as the project path.

## Working Directory

All generated files live under `<project-path>/working-on/<feature-name>/`.

> All file paths in the instructions below are relative to `<project-path>/working-on/<feature-name>/`.

## Instructions

The argument provided is: $ARGUMENTS

Determine the branch name using the following logic:

1. If $ARGUMENTS looks like a branch name (e.g. `feat/my-feature`, `fix/some-bug`, `my-feature-branch` — no spaces, kebab-case or slash-separated), use it as-is.
2. Otherwise treat $ARGUMENTS as a human-readable feature description, convert it to a feature name, and use the format `feat/<derived-name>` as the branch name.

Apply the constraints below to the feature name (the segment after the last `/`) before using it:

### Feature Name Constraints

When deriving a feature name from a description:

- Use only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens (`a-z`, `0-9`, `-`)
- Replace spaces and special characters with hyphens
- Remove consecutive hyphens (e.g. `--` → `-`)
- Remove leading and trailing hyphens
- **Maximum length: 30 characters** — if the derived name exceeds 30 characters, truncate at the last hyphen boundary before or at the 30th character
- If the input is already a valid branch name (no spaces, kebab-case or slash-separated), apply the 30-character limit to the last segment only (after the last `/`)
- Reject (and ask the user to provide a shorter name) if no valid name can be derived after truncation

**Examples:**

| Input | Derived feature name |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `Add user authentication` | `add-user-authentication` |
| `Implement real-time notifications for dashboard` | `implement-real-time` |
| `feat/add-user-authentication` | `add-user-authentication` |
| `feat/implement-real-time-notifications-for-dashboard` | `implement-real-time` |


Once the branch name is determined:

3. Check whether the branch already exists locally or remotely:
   - If it **does not exist**, create and switch to it:
     ```
     git checkout -b <branch-name>
     ```
   - If it **already exists**, warn the user and ask whether to:
     - **Resume** — switch to the existing branch (`git checkout <branch-name>`) and continue
     - **Abort** — stop and do nothing

4. Check whether the working directory `<project-path>/working-on/<feature-name>` already exists:
   - If it **does not exist**, create it:
     ```
     mkdir -p <project-path>/working-on/<feature-name>
     ```
   - If it **already exists**, warn the user and ask whether to:
     - **Resume** — continue into the existing folder (proceed to the next step without recreating it)
     - **Abort** — stop and do nothing

Where `<feature-name>` is the last segment of the branch name (after the last `/`, or the full branch name if no `/` is present).

5. Report the branch name and working directory that were created or resumed.

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS

## Next Step

Run the following command to write the feature specification:

```
/osddt.spec <brief description of the feature being built>
```
