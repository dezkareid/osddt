description: "Mark a feature as done and move it from working-on to done"
---

## Instructions

1. Confirm all tasks in `osddt.tasks.md` are checked off (`- [x]`)
2. Run the following command to move the feature folder from `working-on` to `done`:

```
npx osddt done <feature-name> --dir <project-path>
```

   The command will automatically prefix the destination folder name with today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
   For example, `working-on/feature-a` will be moved to `done/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-a`.

3. Report the result of the command, including the full destination path
